Target:This program finds the probability that x or more users active at the same time for the given number of users(n) where x<=n.

Inputs to the program:

Bandwidth of the link
Bandwidth requirement of the user
Total number of users within a network
The probability that any particular user is idle at a given time
Target number of users 

Output:

the probability that x or more users active at the same time

Program Structure:

1) fact(int x):

	This function calculates factorial of the number x and returns an integer array

2) Combination(int n, int r):

	This function calculates nCr combination value

3) probability(n, r, p):

	This function calculates the probability of x or more members active within in a network in the same time

4) division(int p[],int q[]):

	This function calculates the division of two integer arrays and returns a double value

5) multiplyTwoDigitArrays(int p[], int q[]):
	
	This function returns an array, which is the result of arrays p and q

6) convertNumToArray(int n):
	This function returns an array, which is the digit array of the number n

Execution:

    After unzipping the tar file, type `make` in command terminal. This will compile all my source files (i.e. probability.cpp).In the next step type `./output` in command terminal, after giving proper inputs, the output will be displayed on the screen.
